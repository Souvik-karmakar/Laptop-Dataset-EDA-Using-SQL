# Laptop-Dataset-EDA-Using-SQL
## Overview:-
This case study uses SQL approaches to analyze and explore large amounts of data. User-defined functions, window functions, grouping data, subqueries, indexes, common table expressions, and string operations are some of the key approaches used.

## Data Analysis:-
Data Exploration with SQL (EDA):

Utilized SQL queries to perform exploratory data analysis, mimicking the functionalities of the Pandas library in Python.
Employed SQL queries for quick data overview, including tasks such as summarizing data, identifying missing values, and understanding data distributions.

Statistical Analysis Techniques:

Applied a range of statistical methods within SQL for analysis and inference.
Utilized SQL functions and operations to calculate descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and percentiles.
Conducted hypothesis testing and statistical inference using SQL for concluding the data.

Categorical Data Analysis:

Conducted in-depth analysis of categorical variables using SQL.
Utilized SQL queries to explore frequency distributions, mode calculation, and identify unique categories within categorical variables.
Employed SQL's group-by and aggregation functions for summarizing categorical data and gaining insights.

Cross-Column Analysis:

Explored relationships between different columns within the dataset using SQL queries.
Conducted correlation analysis, cross-tabulations, and conditional aggregations to uncover patterns and dependencies between variables.
Leveraged SQL joins and subqueries for merging and analyzing data from multiple tables, enabling deeper insights into relationships between columns.
